Here lies all of the useful code that i have made to do analysis at wvu. It also will sever as my portfoilo. 
I still need to go into these code and fix things but that will come with time. 

# Unwrap 
is the code that i made for Loos to unwrap a selection of things 
# Missing_loop_tool
Take any given pdb code and uses modeller to add in the missing parts into it. 
It at the time only works with monomers
# slow Eq 
A python code set that runs a very slow process of min heating and Eq 
as done by Dr. Joe Baker
# regression 
the Lmax linear regression code that i have done. Needs to to be looked at 
# gather_data_regression
all the code that I use to gather the linear regression stuff 
# Ret_codes
All the codes i can find to attach the retainal and make the mutations of BR
