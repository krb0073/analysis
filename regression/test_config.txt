# Kyle Billings 1/12/21
# linear regression confing example
####### required paramters ###############
data_range 0 558940

seed 1000

# for the data range if you want to only count ever 10 frames you can put tem after for skip


max_var 3

Lmax 570 590 550 412 560 640

#this will list the file prefixes to look for
FILE_PREFIXES clean_bR_all clean_K_all clean_L_all clean_M_all clean_N_all clean_O_all

# provide the list of what to call the indexes
systems bR K L M N O

#NOTE: inorder for the program to run Lamx, systems and FILE_PREFIXES must tbe the same lenght
#Note 2: the program WILL NOT check to see if the order for each is correct. thats your job.

# there are two methods that are supported at this time

# this will only use one of the sets and do leave one out crossvaialdtion for modeling
#method LOOCV

method KFOLD

####### paramters that can be added ########################

# setting a tolerance in the file will ensire that the data point of an obseravtion will be
## spread out at leat that much e.i if TOLERANCE is set to 0.5 all values must be greater than 0.5 from each other

#TOLERANCE 0

# if the purge_cutoff is on then the values with preason coerrleations greater than it will be removed
## the min values is 0.01

purge_cutoff 0.5

# if Nfolds is on the data will be split into that many sets before the medain values are taken

Nfolds 10

# change the output dir loaction using

DIR_NAME /media/bak22/BR_Photo/BR/newDataSet/DATAall/cleaned_data/

# if the suffix of your data files is not dat use this to cahnge it

#suffix txt

# to include the area under the curve  use this setting

#AUC ./1600877851_RMSF/

# to change the number of regression graphs for each number of varaibles use

KEEP_NUM 3

# the defult scoring method to campre between line from the same number of var is MSE
# but BIC AIC and RSS are all supproted

SCORING_METRIC MSE

# when doing the 10% validation method we set the flipp to ture by

Flipp False

# if you want to do a train test split and not use a set of data for modeling then

NUMBER_LEFT_OUT 5
### if you do not want the data mixed
#NO_MIX
